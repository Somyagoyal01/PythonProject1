# Personalized Greeting Program

## Functionality
This Python program generates a personalized greeting message by following these steps:

1. Prompts the user to enter their **first name** and **last name**.
2. Concatenates both inputs to form a **full name**.
3. Prints a greeting message using the full name.

## Expected Behavior
- If the user enters `John` as the first name and `Doe` as the last name, the output will be:
  ```
  Hey! John Doe, Welcome to Python programming
  ```

## Usage
Run the Python script, enter your first and last name when prompted, and receive a personalized greeting message.
