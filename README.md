# Basic Mathematical Operations

## Functionality
This Python program performs basic mathematical operations on two user-input numbers. It follows these steps:

1. Prompts the user to enter two numbers.
2. Performs the following operations:
   - Addition
   - Subtraction
   - Multiplication
   - Division
3. Displays the results of each operation.

## Expected Behavior
- If the user inputs `10` and `5`, the output will be:
  ```
  Addition = 15
  Subtraction = 5
  Multiplication = 50
  Division = 2.0
  ```

## Usage
Run the Python script, enter two numbers when prompted, and the program will display the results of all basic operations.
